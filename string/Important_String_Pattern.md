# Common String Patterns in DSA


## 1. String Matching

- **Brute Force**: Finding a substring within a string by checking all possible positions.
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: Efficiently searching for a substring using a precomputed partial match table.
- **Regular Expressions**: Utilizing regex patterns to match and extract substrings.

## 2. Anagrams

- **Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. In string patterns, anagrams are relevant in two main ways:
  - Checking if two strings are anagrams of each other, meaning they have the same set of characters but may be in a different order.
  - Finding all anagrams of a given string, which involves generating all possible rearrangements of its characters.

## 3. Palindromes

- Determining if a string is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards.
- Finding the longest palindromic substring within a string.

## 4. String Reversal

- Reversing a string, either in-place or by creating a new reversed string.

## 5. String Manipulation

- Removing or replacing characters in a string.
- Rearranging characters in a specific way.

## 6. String Permutations

- Generating all permutations of a given string.

## 7. Substring Problems

- Finding the longest or shortest substring that satisfies specific conditions (e.g., containing all distinct characters or having a specific character frequency).

## 8. Regular Expressions

- Implementing or using regular expressions to match and manipulate strings.

## 9. Trie Data Structure

- Implementing or using a trie (prefix tree) for efficient string search and manipulation operations.

## 10. String Compression

- Compressing a string by replacing repeated characters with their counts.
