The Dutch National Flag Algorithm is a popular technique for sorting an array that contains three distinct values (commonly 0s, 1s, and 2s) into the correct order. While it's a specific algorithm, questions related to this algorithm or similar sorting problems may appear in technical interviews at FAANG companies or other tech giants. Here are some example questions related to the Dutch National Flag Algorithm:

1. **Sort an Array of 0s and 1s**: Given an array containing only 0s and 1s, implement the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort the array in linear time without using extra space.

2. **Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s**: Given an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s (representing red, white, and blue), use the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort the array in linear time without using extra space.

3. **K Colors Sort**: Generalize the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort an array of elements into K distinct colors. Provide an algorithm and its time complexity.

4. **Variation with Duplicate Values**: Modify the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to handle arrays with duplicate values. How does this change the algorithm's time complexity?

5. **Partitioning for QuickSort**: Explain how the Dutch National Flag Algorithm can be used as a partitioning step in the QuickSort algorithm. Provide the time complexity analysis.

6. **Minimum Swaps to Sort**: Given an unsorted array, find the minimum number of swaps needed to sort it using the Dutch National Flag Algorithm.

7. **Rainbow Sort**: Suppose you have an array containing colors represented by numbers. Implement the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort the array in rainbow order (e.g., red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).

8. **Online Judge Problem**: Solve a coding challenge on an online judge platform that requires you to use the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort an array with a specific set of rules or constraints.

9. **Stable Dutch National Flag Sort**: Implement a stable version of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm that preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.

10. **Time Complexity Analysis**: Explain the time complexity of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm, and discuss its efficiency in sorting arrays with a large number of elements.

These questions may vary in difficulty, and some may include additional constraints or variations of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm. Preparing for such questions can help you understand sorting algorithms, partitioning techniques, and their applications in solving real-world problems.
