While both the Prefix Sum (Cumulative Sum) Array and the Two-Pointer Technique can be used to solve problems related to arrays, they serve different purposes and are applied in different scenarios. Here's a comparison of the two:

**Prefix Sum (Cumulative Sum) Array**:
- Purpose: The Prefix Sum Array is primarily used for efficiently calculating and storing cumulative sums of elements in an array.
- Key Use Case: It's particularly useful when you need to find the sum of elements in a specific range of an array quickly and efficiently.
- Efficiency: Constructing the Prefix Sum Array requires a one-time linear pass through the original array (O(n)), and subsequent range sum queries have a constant time complexity of O(1).

**Two-Pointer Technique**:
- Purpose: The Two-Pointer Technique is a general approach used for various array problems, including searching for pairs, subarrays with specific properties, or solving problems involving pointers moving towards each other.
- Key Use Case: It's often used when you need to find pairs, subarrays, or specific elements that satisfy certain conditions within the array.
- Efficiency: The efficiency of the Two-Pointer Technique varies depending on the problem. In some cases, it may involve a linear pass through the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), but it can also have different complexities depending on the specific problem.

In summary, while both techniques deal with arrays, the Prefix Sum Array is specialized for efficiently calculating cumulative sums and performing range sum queries, whereas the Two-Pointer Technique is a versatile approach used for a broader range of problems, including those involving pairs, subarrays, and specific conditions. They are distinct techniques, and the choice of which one to use depends on the problem's requirements and constraints.
