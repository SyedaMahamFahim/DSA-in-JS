## Frequency-Based Array Patterns

Frequency-based operations on arrays are indeed important and often used in various programming problems. Here are some frequency-related array patterns:

1. **Counting Sort**: Counting sort is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers when the range of values is known and not too large. It works by counting the frequency of each element and then reconstructing the sorted array.

2. **Frequency Counting**: Counting the frequency of elements in an array is a common task. You can use a hashmap or an auxiliary array to keep track of the frequency of each element. This pattern is frequently used for finding duplicates, identifying the majority element, or solving problems related to occurrences of elements.

3. **Top K Frequent Elements**: Given an array, you often need to find the top K frequent elements. This can be efficiently solved using a priority queue (min-heap or max-heap) to maintain the K most frequent elements as you traverse the array.

4. **Mode of an Array**: The mode of an array is the element that appears most frequently. To find the mode, you can use the frequency counting technique mentioned earlier and keep track of the element with the highest frequency.

5. **Frequency-Based Filtering**: In many problems, you need to filter or manipulate an array based on the frequency of elements. For example, you might want to filter out elements that appear more than a certain number of times or less than a certain number of times.

6. **Frequency-Based Bucketing**: Sometimes, you can optimize array-related problems by grouping elements into buckets based on their frequencies. This is particularly useful when you need to process elements with similar frequencies together.

7. **Frequency Histogram**: Creating a histogram of element frequencies can be helpful for visualizing data or solving specific problems. You can use this pattern to analyze and gain insights from frequency distributions in the data.

8. **Frequency-Based Queries**: In problems where you're given queries that involve counting elements within a subarray or range, precomputing and storing the frequencies of elements can lead to efficient query processing.

These frequency-related patterns are essential for solving a wide range of problems where understanding the distribution of elements in an array is crucial. Depending on the specific problem, you may need to adapt and combine these patterns to achieve the desired outcome efficiently.
