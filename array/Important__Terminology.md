# Important Terminology in Array Patterns

- **Array**: An ordered collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays have a fixed size in many programming languages, and elements are typically of the same data type.

- **Element**: Each individual item in an array is called an element. Elements can be of any data type, such as integers, floats, strings, or objects.

- **Index**: An integer value that represents the position of an element within an array. Indexing is often zero-based, meaning the first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.

- **Length/Size**: The number of elements contained in an array. It indicates the size or capacity of the array.

- **Access**: Retrieving the value of an element in an array by specifying its index. For example, accessing `arr[2]` retrieves the element at index 2 in the array `arr`.

- **Traversal**: The process of visiting and processing each element in an array. It can be done sequentially or using loops like `for` or `while`.

- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to an array. Depending on the language and implementation, insertion can occur at the beginning, end, or a specific index of the array.

- **Deletion**: Removing an element from an array. Similarly, deletion can occur at different positions within the array.

- **Searching**: The process of finding the index or position of a specific element within an array. Common searching algorithms include linear search and binary search.

- **Sorting**: Arranging the elements of an array in a specific order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.

- **Subarray**: A contiguous sequence of elements within an array. A subarray can be created by specifying a range of indices, e.g., `arr[2:5]`.

- **Subsequence**: A sequence of elements within an array that may not be contiguous. Elements in a subsequence are not required to be adjacent to each other.

- **Duplicated Elements**: Elements that occur more than once in an array.

- **Unique Elements**: Elements that appear only once in an array.

- **Frequency**: The number of times a specific element appears in an array.

- **Maximum/Minimum Element**: The largest and smallest elements in an array, respectively.

- **Sum of Elements**: The result of adding all elements in an array together.

- **Median**: The middle element of a sorted array, or the average of the two middle elements if the array has an even length.

- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum elements in an array.

- **Rotations**: Shifting the elements of an array by a fixed number of positions, either to the left or right.

- **Leaders**: A leader element in an array is an element that is greater than all the elements to its right. For example, in the array [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2], the leaders are 17, 5, and 2. 
The rightmost element in an array is always a leader element, because there are no elements to its right.
