A Prefix Sum (Cumulative Sum) Array is a data structure used to efficiently calculate and store cumulative sums of elements in an array. It is particularly useful when you need to find the sum of elements in a specific range of an array quickly. This technique can be applied to various problems where frequent range sum queries are involved.

Here's an explanation of the Prefix Sum Array:

**1. Initialization**:
   - Given an array `arr` of length `n`, create a new array `prefixSum` of the same length (`n`) to store the cumulative sums.
   - Initialize the first element of `prefixSum` as the same as the first element of `arr`, i.e., `prefixSum[0] = arr[0]`.

**2. Calculating Prefix Sums**:
   - Iterate through the original array `arr` from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index `n-1`).
   - For each element at index `i`, calculate the cumulative sum up to that point and store it in the corresponding index of the `prefixSum` array. The formula for this is: `prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + arr[i]`.

**3. Using Prefix Sums for Range Queries**:
   - Once the `prefixSum` array is constructed, it allows for very efficient range sum queries. To find the sum of elements in a range `[l, r]` in the original array `arr`, you can use the `prefixSum` array as follows:
   
   ```
   sumInRange(l, r) = prefixSum[r] - prefixSum[l-1]   // if l > 0
   sumInRange(0, r) = prefixSum[r]                    // if l = 0
   ```

   This formula calculates the cumulative sum up to index `r` and subtracts the cumulative sum up to index `l-1` (if `l > 0`) to get the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]`. If `l` is equal to `0`, you can directly use `prefixSum[r]` as the sum of elements in the range `[0, r]`.

**4. Efficiency**:
   - The construction of the `prefixSum` array requires a one-time linear pass through the original array `arr`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
   - Subsequent range sum queries using the `prefixSum` array are extremely efficient and have a constant time complexity of O(1).

**Example**:

Consider the original array `arr`:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Constructing the `prefixSum` array:

1. `prefixSum[0] = 1` (same as `arr[0]`).
2. `prefixSum[1] = prefixSum[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
3. `prefixSum[2] = prefixSum[1] + arr[2] = 3 + 3 = 6`.
4. `prefixSum[3] = prefixSum[2] + arr[3] = 6 + 4 = 10`.
5. `prefixSum[4] = prefixSum[3] + arr[4] = 10 + 5 = 15`.

Now, to find the sum of elements in the range `[1, 3]` (i.e., `arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3]`), you can use the `prefixSum` array:

```
sumInRange(1, 3) = prefixSum[3] - prefixSum[0] = 10 - 1 = 9
```

The Prefix Sum Array simplifies range sum queries, making them much more efficient, especially when dealing with large arrays or frequent sum calculations within specific ranges.
